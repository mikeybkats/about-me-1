      <p>Hello all, this page is dedicated to John 'jp' Gaines and everything you need to know while still preserving anonymity.</p>
    <h1>bio</h1>
      <p>Jp was born in Chicago Illinois to working-class parents from Texas.  He was raised to be responsible, work hard, respect the people around him, and to help when he could.  These lessons are the very same lesson he tries to pass on to his children.  "Lead by example" has always been a guiding principal in his adult life as evidenced by his reputation in the marine indusrty as someone who can be counted on to take care of his crew and his vessel while making sure the job is done correctly.  I want to be like him when I grow up!</p>
